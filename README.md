This is my very own NextJS starter, suitable for my own purposes. Feel free to use it if it suits yours too :)

At the moment it includes:

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
-   [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)

It also...

-   Has a minimal template
-   Uses lint-staged to run prettier on pre-commit
-   Has the source code under `/src` (as it should be)

Everything else is (or should be) pretty much standard. For now at least.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-next-app [name] --use-npm --example "https://github.com/carlosgarciamar/nextjs-starter"
```

Or clone it and run `npm install`...

Then `npm run dev`.

## Thinking about adding...

* Jest
* Conventional Commits
* Cypress
